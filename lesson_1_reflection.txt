How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
 was introduced?


Observing changes made and finding errors in them.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?


Track changes made and learn from past errors or improvements implemented.




What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google 
docs does?

    


Pros: Commits occur exactly as required, commits reflect a completed change
Cons: Amount of changes between commit may be too little to too much, changes are lost if computer crashes before a commit is made



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?



Coding files may be interrelated and changes in one file may result in changes in another




How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?



git log to view all commits made. git diff to view the differences between two commits




How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
 could break something?



Enables reversion to a previous version if changes cause errors


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
